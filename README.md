# Only42 Token Project ü™ô

## Overview
This project implements an ERC-20 token called "Only42" (O42) as part of the 42 School Web3 curriculum. The token is developed using Solidity and deployed using Remix IDE with enhanced security features including pause/unpause controls, burn functionality, and owner-based access control.

## Project Choices and Rationale

### Blockchain Platform: Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
- **Choice**: BSC Testnet for development, targeting BSC ecosystem
- **Rationale**: 
  - Lower gas fees compared to Ethereum
  - Fast transaction confirmation times
  - Wide adoption and growing ecosystem
  - Compatible with Ethereum tooling (EVM-compatible)
  - Excellent for learning and testing Web3 concepts
  - The most important: No need to have BNB on mainnet

### Development Environment: Remix IDE
- **Choice**: Remix IDE (https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- **Rationale**:
  - Browser-based, no local setup required
  - Built-in compiler and debugger
  - Integrated deployment tools with MetaMask
  - Excellent for learning and prototyping
  - Direct integration with public blockchains
  - A lot of videos and stuff were on Remix

### Token Standard: ERC-20 with Security Extensions
- **Choice**: ERC-20 + OpenZeppelin security modules
- **Rationale**:
  - Industry standard for fungible tokens
  - Maximum compatibility with wallets and exchanges
  - Well-documented and battle-tested
  - OpenZeppelin provides audited security implementations
  - A lot of videos was on ERC-20 too

### Security Framework: OpenZeppelin Contracts
- **Choice**: OpenZeppelin Contracts v4.9.0
- **Rationale**:
  - Audited and secure contract implementations
  - Industry best practices for access control
  - Modular design (ERC20 + Ownable + Pausable)
  - Reduces development time and security risks

## Smart Contract Features

### Core Functionality
- **ERC-20 Compliance**: Full compatibility with ERC-20 standard
- **Fixed Supply**: 42 tokens maximum (mined through problem solving)
- **Burnable**: Token holders can permanently destroy their tokens
- **Pausable**: Owner can halt all transfers in emergency situations
- **Ownable**: Administrative functions restricted to contract owner
- **Mining System**: 
  - Solve math problems to earn tokens
  - Initial reward: 0.0042 tokens
  - Rewards halve every 5000 solved problems
  - Maximum 10 active problems at once

### Security Features
- **Access Control**: Only owner can pause/unpause the contract
- **Balance Validation**: Burn function includes balance checks
- **Event Logging**: All major operations emit events for transparency
- **Overflow Protection**: Using Solidity 0.8.30 built-in overflow checks
- **Multisig System**:
  - Multiple owners for critical actions
  - Configurable approval threshold
  - Proposal-based governance

### Constructor Parameters
```solidity
constructor(
    address _initialOwner,      // Initial token owner
    address[] memory _multisigOwners,  // Array of multisig owners
    uint256 _requiredApprovals  // Required approvals for actions
)
```

### Custom Events
```solidity
event TokensMinted(address indexed to, uint256 amount);
event TokensBurned(address indexed from, uint256 amount);
event ContractPaused(address indexed by);
event ContractUnpaused(address indexed by);
```

```

## Getting Started

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. Create new workspace for "Token42"
3. Import OpenZeppelin contracts
4. Copy contracts from `code/` folder
5. Compile and test in JavaScript VM
6. Follow private-deployment to test the token
7. Follow public-deployment for publishing it on public blockchain

## Security Considerations

- All contracts will be based on OpenZeppelin's audited implementations
- Proper access control for administrative functions
- Protection against common vulnerabilities (reentrancy, overflow, etc.)
- Multisig wallet for enhanced security (bonus feature)

## Contract Addresses


- **Testnet**: 0x87b8eBac27a50014d07075769Df0df040781Cf7e
- **Network**: TBD
